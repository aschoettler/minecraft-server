# Minecraft Server
My personal minecraft server customization materials

# WELCOME!
There are **multiple servers** you can connect to. Use `/server` to see them and click any server name to connect to it.

Within each server there can be **multiple worlds**. Use the multiverse command `/mv list` to see them.

To **switch worlds**:
- walk through a multiverse portal that goes there
- right-click a multiverse sign
- OR use the command `/mv tp w:<worldname>` so for example `/mv tp w:home` will take you to the `home` world (on the creative server).
